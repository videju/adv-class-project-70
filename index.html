				<p class="text-muted text-left">A school library (or a school library media center) is a library within a school where students, staff, and often, parents of a public or private school have access to a variety of resources. The goal of the school library media center is to ensure that all members of the school community have equitable access "to books and reading, to information, and to information technology." A school library media center "uses all types of media... is automated, and utilizes the Internet [as well as books] for information gathering." School libraries are distinct from public libraries because they serve as "learner-oriented laboratories which support, extend, and individualize the school's curriculum... A school library serves as the center and coordinating agency for all material used in the school." Researchers have demonstrated that school libraries have a positive impact on student achievement through the more than 60 studies that have been conducted in 19 U.S. states and one Canadian province. The major finding of these studies was that students with access to a well-supported school library media program with a qualified school library media specialist, scored higher on reading assessments regardless of their socio-economic statuses. In addition, a study conducted in Ohio revealed that 99.4% of students surveyed believed that their school librarians and school library media programs helped them succeed in school. A report that reported similar conclusions was compiled by Michele Lonsdale</p>

Our school kitchen team prepares fresh meals every day on site. As well as a range of wholesome, nutritious and delicious snacks and meals for all, the team also provides for students with special dietary needs.

There is a daily morning snack, afternoon snack, and at lunchtime a soup starter and two main courses, one of each being a vegetarian option. Parents are provided with a menu in advance of each week and are able to select the food they would like their children to be served each day.

		<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">We’re very proud to have been given the opportunity to install cladding and floor tiling in a newly built swimming pool facility at Newman School in Whiston, Rotherham.

Newman School is a learning community made up of children, young people, families, carers and staff from many different backgrounds. Similarities are shared and differences celebrated. The school focuses on enabling children to develop into adults who are aware of their rights and responsibilities, are tolerant and respectful of others, have a sense of fascination at the natural world and a healthy self-esteem.

“This local Special Educational Needs (SEND) establishment, run by Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council, features a small swimming pool that the youngsters use almost on a daily basis,” explains Tim Vaughan, director at A Cumberlidge.
